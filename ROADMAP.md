# OpenCode Frontend Roadmap

## Overview
Building a modern, mobile-responsive frontend for controlling multiple conversations with an agentic AI that can run commands, modify code, and chat with users.

## Technology Stack
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite (fast development, excellent mobile support)
- **UI Framework**: Tailwind CSS + Headless UI (mobile-first approach)
- **State Management**: Zustand (lightweight, perfect for real-time data)
- **Real-time Communication**: Native WebSockets + gRPC-Web (Go backend compatible)
- **WebSocket Client**: Built-in WebSocket API with reconnection logic
- **gRPC**: @grpc/grpc-js + grpc-web for streaming (when needed)
- **Icons**: Lucide React (lightweight, beautiful icons)
- **Mobile Support**: PWA capabilities, responsive design

## Phase 1: Project Setup & Core Infrastructure ✅
- [x] Initialize Vite + React + TypeScript project
- [x] Configure Tailwind CSS for mobile-first design
- [x] Set up project structure and basic routing
- [x] Install core dependencies

## Phase 2: Core Layout & Navigation ✅
- [x] Create responsive layout with sidebar/drawer for conversations
- [x] Implement mobile-friendly navigation (hamburger menu, swipe gestures)
- [x] Design conversation list component
- [x] Add responsive header with controls

## Phase 3: Conversation Management ✅
- [x] Create conversation state management (Zustand store)
- [x] Implement conversation CRUD operations (mock data)
- [x] Design conversation cards/items in sidebar
- [x] Add conversation search and filtering

## Phase 4: Chat Interface ✅
- [x] Build main chat area with message components
- [x] Create different message types (user, AI, system, code, command)
- [x] Implement message input with mobile-friendly controls
- [x] Add typing indicators and message status

## Phase 5: Agentic AI Features ✅
- [x] Design command execution display components
- [x] Create code modification viewers (diff views)
- [x] Implement file/code browser within chat
- [x] Add action buttons for AI suggestions

## Phase 6: Real-time Communication (Mock) ✅
- [x] Set up native WebSocket client with reconnection logic
- [x] Create mock WebSocket connection handlers for Go backend
- [x] Implement gRPC-Web client structure for streaming
- [x] Add message streaming simulation with proper error handling
- [x] Add connection status indicators and retry mechanisms

## Phase 7: Mobile Optimization ✅
- [x] Implement PWA manifest and service worker
- [x] Add touch gestures (swipe to delete, pull to refresh)
- [x] Optimize for various screen sizes (phone, tablet, desktop)
- [x] Test performance on mobile devices

## Phase 8: Advanced Features ✅
- [x] Add conversation export/import
- [x] Create notification system
- [ ] Implement conversation themes/settings
- [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts

## Phase 9: Testing & Polish ✅
- [x] Add comprehensive error handling (ErrorBoundary, notification system)
- [x] Implement loading states and skeletons
- [ ] Add accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- [ ] Performance optimization and code splitting

## Phase 10: Documentation & Deployment
- [ ] Create API integration documentation
- [ ] Add deployment configuration
- [ ] Create user documentation
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline

## Key Features to Implement

### Conversation Management
- Multiple conversations support
- Conversation creation, deletion, renaming
- Search and filter conversations
- Conversation history and persistence

### Chat Interface
- Real-time message streaming
- Multiple message types (text, code, commands, files)
- Message reactions and threading
- Code syntax highlighting
- Copy/paste functionality

### Agentic AI Integration
- Command execution visualization
- Code modification tracking
- File system integration
- Action suggestions and confirmations

### Mobile Experience
- Touch-friendly interface
- Responsive design (320px to 4K)
- Offline capability (PWA)
- Fast loading and smooth animations

## Success Criteria
1. ✅ Fully responsive on all device sizes
2. ✅ Smooth real-time message streaming
3. ✅ Intuitive conversation management
4. ✅ Easy API integration when backend is ready
5. ✅ Excellent mobile user experience
6. ✅ Fast performance (<2s initial load)

## Go Backend Integration Notes

### WebSocket Communication
- Use native WebSocket API (no Socket.IO needed)
- Implement custom reconnection logic with exponential backoff
- Handle connection state management in Zustand store
- Support JSON message protocol for easy Go struct marshaling

### gRPC-Web for Streaming
- Use @grpc/grpc-js and grpc-web for bidirectional streaming
- Generate TypeScript types from .proto files
- Implement streaming for real-time conversation updates
- Handle gRPC status codes and error messages

### API Structure Considerations
- RESTful endpoints for conversation CRUD operations
- WebSocket for real-time messaging and agent updates
- gRPC streaming for file transfers and large data
- JWT authentication flow compatible with Go middleware

### Mock Implementation Strategy
- Create TypeScript interfaces matching Go struct patterns
- Use WebSocket mock server that simulates Go Gorilla WebSocket behavior
- Implement message queuing simulation for agent command execution
- Design JSON schemas that align with Go's encoding/json conventions

## OpenCode Project Roadmap (Backend Integration)

This roadmap outlines the key steps to achieve the basic functionality of the OpenCode project, focusing on single-tenancy and integration with the backend.

### Frontend (opencode-frontend)

- [ ] Explore the existing frontend codebase.
- [ ] Understand how the frontend interacts with the orchestrator.
- [ ] Implement basic session management (start/stop session).
- [ ] Display server logs in a new tab/section.

### Backend (opencode-backend)

- [ ] Explore the existing backend codebase (orchestrator and server).
- [ ] Understand session creation and management.
- [ ] Verify proxy exposure of the server.
- [ ] Ensure basic functionality for AI agent interaction.

### General

- [ ] Create a new branch for development.
- [ ] Commit and push changes frequently.
- [ ] Implement tests where needed.
- [ ] Install necessary tools and dependencies.
